ABSA Data-Journalism Training
For African financial-economic reporters and editors 

Peter Verweij

Is debt creeping back up in Sub-Saharan Africa? This is an interesting question for financial reporters and editors. A quick search learns that the medium sovereign debt-to-GDP ratio is more than 50%. But how do we analyze and report about this fact? A traditional procedure is to ask opinions of politicians and or financial experts and bankers. Data journalism is proposing an other route: a transition from he 'said-she said journalism' to 'fact based' or 'evidence based' reporting. Get the data, analyze and report!

In this training of three days we will map the different routes in data journalism landscape, using examples as sovereign debt crisis, financial inclusion, and GDP growth to social development and other local data. First we have to find our data: how to download data from a database, or scrape the figures from a web-page or Pdf document. Next we have to analyze the data by calculating key figures and visualize trends in various graphs or maps. And finally we have to produce the story, for hard-copy, TV or on-line. 

The training is hands-on, that is after an example showing how to do a step, you have to do it yourself; of course offering assistance when needed. Other data and assignments are available in the cloud for more practicing. On the other hand there is time available to work in small groups on your own data journalism project, practicing the new tools. At the end of the training each groups show the results of the projects in class. For example calculate a Big Max Index, based on the example of the Economist, for Sub-Sahara Africa, showing the value of your local currency.

All software, data, and assignments will be available at the computers of the computer-lab. If you want to bring your own laptop, make sure that the following software is installed:
